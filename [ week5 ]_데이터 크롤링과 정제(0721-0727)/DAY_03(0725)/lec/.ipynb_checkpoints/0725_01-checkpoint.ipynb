      "Residents informed authorities at Girnar Wildlife Sanctuary after they spotted the reptile lying in discomfort in a field.\n",
      "In view of the massive swelling of the python’s stomach, the forest authorities suspect that it gobbled up a full-grown ‘nilgai’ or blue bull.\n",
      "The python - unable to move now - was rescued by the forest personnel and has been put under observation.\n",
      "“We will keep it (python) under observation. We will release it back in the wild once it digests the antelope and the swelling subsides,” said Assistant Conservator of Forest, S.D. Tilala.\n",
      "A blue bull is far larger than an ideal prey for pythons and digesting the mammal could prove to be a great struggle for the reptile.\n",
      "When unable to digest an unusually large prey, pythons are known to regurgitate them.\n",

      "Python Challenge 2013, a month-long event sponsored by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, is open to hunters and non-hunters alike.\n",
      "But the idea of luring weapon-wielding amateurs into the harsh environment of the Everglades has raised some alarms.\n",

The vast majority of them will probably curtail their hunting very quickly when they figure out there’s a lot of mosquitoes, it’s hot, it’s rather boring sometimes - most of the time really, and I think a lot of them will go home,” Heflick said.\n",

      " LONDON (Reuters) - A British woman who illegally imported and sold fashion accessories made from python skin was convicted on Friday, London police said.\n",
      "Stephanie Scolaro, 26, was involved in the illegal import of a parcel containing 10 python-skin hats and two bags which was seized by customs in 2016 at Leipzig airport in Germany, Southwark Crown Court had heard.\n",
      "An investigation began after London police’s Wildlife Crime Unit was alerted to the incident.\n",
      "The enquiry found that Scolaro operated an online company named ‘SS-Python.com’, where she sold python-skin hats, bags, chokers and mobile phone covers.\n",
      "More illicit python snake products were subsequently found in Scolaro’s central London home, and for sale at three shops in London.\n",
      "“Pythons are one of many species protected under CITES, an international treaty to protect endangered plants and animals,” said Sarah Bailey of the Wildlife Crime Unit.\n",
      "“Any trade outside of the legal framework could threaten the conservation status of the remaining wild population and contribute to its decline in the wild,” she added in a statement.\n",
      "Scolaro, who pleaded guilty, will be sentenced on Jan. 21.\n",

      "BODY:\n",
      " LONDON (Reuters) - The surviving members of the British comedy troupe Monty Python lost a High Court battle on Friday over tens of thousands of pounds in royalties from their hit Broadway musical “Spamalot”.\n",
      "Mark Forstater, who helped produce the 1975 film “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” on which the stage show was based, said he had not received his fair share of the profits from the spin-off.\n",
      "Despite hearing evidence from three Pythons - Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones - the judge, Justice Alastair Norris, sided with the producer.\n",
      "“I have always been adamant I was correct. I have been proved right - justice has prevailed,” Forstater said.\n",
      "Inspired by the film, the musical opened on Broadway in 2005 and has also enjoyed a successful run in Britain. Idle wrote the lyrics and collaborated on most of the music.\n",
      "Forstater, an American based in Britain, argued that he was entitled to one-seventh of the profits from the “Holy Grail” film and any merchandise or spin-offs.\n",
      "His lawyer told the court that for the purposes of profit-sharing, it had been agreed in 1974 that Forstater was “the seventh Python”.\n",
      "However Palin, along with Jones and Idle, who formed Monty Python with John Cleese, Terry Gilliam and Graham Chapman, dismissed this suggestion.\n",
      "“The idea of a seventh Python just doesn’t happen ... I don’t think there was ever any suggestion this man was going to be a ‘seventh Python’,” said Palin, giving evidence in December.\n",
      "In his judgment, Norris said Palin had been a “balanced and trustworthy” witness but had admitted his recollection was “hazy”, while evidence from Jones had been “suffused with a sense that Mr Forstater had done very well out of his brief connection with the Pythons”.\n",
      "“Eric Idle was frank enough to acknowledge that he now disliked Mr Forstater, but he expressed the hope that, in his evidence, he was being honest and that his dislike did not affect his honesty,” Norris said.\n",
      "“He undoubtedly regarded Mr Forstater as ungrateful.”\n",
      "“SOFT LOT”\n",
      "His ruling also made reference to the Pythons’ lack of business acumen, highlighting a diary entry from Palin in 1975.\n",
      "“As we are a soft lot and not at all businesslike, I think it would be in the finest traditions of Python irrationality if we gave Mark an extra 1,000 pounds and a silver tray with some cut-glass sherry glasses and told him to stop writing to us for more money,” Palin wrote.\n",
      "“Beyond that even I am not prepared to go. Oh, all right, some cheese straws to go with the sherry glasses.”\n",
      "The judge added: “As I assess the evidence, the Pythons continued at that point to be ‘a soft lot and not at all businesslike’.”\n",
      "No members of the Python group were present in court to hear the ruling.\n",
      "Final figures will be worked out at later hearings but Forstater told reporters he was entitled to more than 200,000 pounds ($300,000) including interest, the Press Association reported.\n",
      "“There is a sadness, though, about having to face people who were my friends in court,” he said. “The friendship has gone.”\n",
      "Forstater said he did not think the litigation would damage the Pythons’ reputation. “They’re an institution,” he said. “I still think they are very funny.”\n",

I had no clue that civilians were also present at the spot and something could go wrong as all the officials are highly trained.

      " MIAMI (Reuters) - Engineers in the Everglades stumbled upon a near-record-breaking Burmese python measuring more than 18 feet long during a routine inspection of levees on Tuesday, a water management district spokesman said.\n",
      "The snake, measuring at 18 feet 2 inches, fell short of the state record by 6 inches, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\n",
      "Last year, a snake collector in the state discovered the largest python on record there, measuring 18 feet 8 inches, commission spokeswoman Katie Johnson said.\n",
      "The pythons, which can grow to more than 20 feet in their native habitat in Southeast Asia, are one of the most problematic invaders of Florida’s sprawling Everglades wetlands.\n",
      "They eat indigenous species and their food sources, fueling concerns that the predator snakes will fundamentally change the ecosystem.\n",
      "The python found on Tuesday was killed, and its corpse was taken to the University of Florida, where it will be measured and studied by scientists trying to combat the species, according to South Florida Water Management District spokesman Gabe Margasak.\n",
      "Officials have said the python population is believed to have grown to as many as 150,000 in the Everglades. The cold-blooded reptiles are often found atop levees, where they lie for hours at a time to warm up under the Florida sun.\n",
      "The snakes, one of the largest species in the world, found a home to their liking in the Everglades when pet owners started using the wetlands as a convenient dumping ground.\n",

      "[BODY]:\n",
      "EDMONTON, Alberta, July 24 (Reuters) - Pope Francis landed in Canada on Sunday to kick off a week-long trip that will center around his apology on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church for the abuse that indigenous children endured at mostlychurch-run residential schools.\n",
      "\"This is a trip of penance. Let's say that is its spirit,\" the pope told reporters after his flight took off from Rome.\n",
      "The papal planetouched down in Edmonton in the western province of Alberta, where he will visit a former residential school and meet with indigenous peoples on Monday. He is also visiting Quebec City and Iqaluit, the capital of the territory of Nunavut. He will depart on Friday.\n",
      "Between 1881 and 1996 more than 150,000 indigenous children were separated from their families and brought to residential schools. Many children were starved, beaten and sexually abused in a system that Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission called \"cultural genocide.\"\n",
      "The papal plane taxied with Canadian and Vatican flags flapping outside the cockpit windows. After disembarking with the help of a lift, the pope boarded a white Fiat 500X, which dropped him at the hangar. He then proceeded by wheelchair.\n",
      "Governor General Mary Simon, who represents Canada's head of state, Queen Elizabeth, was the first to greet the pope. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau followed.\n",
      "The pope sat between the two Canadian officials for a short performance of four drummers and native singing before several indigenous leaders, many wearing elaborate headdresses, greeted and exchanged gifts with him.\n",
      "\"I asked today the pope to walk with us,\" Grand Chief George Arcand of the Confederacy of Treaty Six First Nations said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. \"It was a very humbling experience to talk to your holiness.\"\n",
      "RoseAnne Archibald, national chief for the Assembly of First Nations, who also greeted the pope, criticized the \"unilateral\" organization of the trip and the \"archaic\" nature of the church, which has no women in leadership positions.\n",
      "Pope Francis is welcomed after arriving at Edmonton International Airport, near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada July 24, 2022. REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane\n",
      "\"We don't feel that it has been about survivors\" of residential schools, she told reporters at the airport. \"It has been more about the church promoting the church's idea, fundraising for the church.\"\n",
      "The pope left after the short ceremony in a wheelchair to speak for a few minutes in private with Trudeau and other officials before heading to St. Joseph Seminary, where he is expected to rest before Monday's events.\n",
      "The 85-year-old pope canceled a trip to Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan in early July because of a knee problem that has recently forced him to use a wheelchair and a cane.\n",
      "Earlier aboard the papal plane, the pope said he yearned to visit Ukraine in his efforts to try and bring an end to the five-month-old war that he has repeatedly decried.  read more \n",
      "\"I have a great desire to go to Kyiv,\" the pope said when asked about a possible future trip to Ukraine.\n",
      "In an exclusive interview earlier this month, the pontiff told Reuters that he hoped to be able to go to Moscow and Kyiv soon after his trip to Canada.  read more \n",
      "While Canada's leaders have known about high numbers of children dying at the residential schools since 1907, the issue was thrust to the fore with the discovery of suspected unmarked graves at or near former residential school sites last year.\n",
      "In response to pressure stemming from those discoveries, the pope apologized for the Catholic church's role in the schools earlier this year during a visit by indigenous delegates to the Vatican.  read more \n",
      "Now he is preparing to apologize on Canadian soil. But survivors and indigenous leaders have told Reuters they want more.  read more \n",
      "Many have called for financial compensation, the return of indigenous artifacts, the release of school records, support for extraditing an accused abuser, and the rescinding of a 15th-century doctrine justifying colonial dispossession of indigenous people in the form of a papal bull, or edict.  read more \n",

      "TOKYO, July 25 (Reuters) - Japan's asset managers nudged the volume up another notch at shareholder meetings this year, increasingly opposing management proposals and adding momentum to a policy of attracting foreign investors initiated by slain former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n",
      "Nikko Asset Management, Asset Management One and others have become distinct voices in Japan's new-found activism, countering foreign criticism of asset managers' rubber-stamp voting.\n",
      "The pair opposed management at a domestic firm by voting for board nominees proposed by a foreign investor, while in another high-profile case, company management canned a proposal after some asset managers supported a foreign investor's objection.\n",
      "This year's cases add to a gradual change in voting sparked by Abe's corporate stewardship code in 2014, and which gained impetus in 2017 with a revision requiring the disclosure of voting records for each agenda item at shareholder meetings. Abe was shot and killed this month during an election campaign.\n",
      "The revision \"raised asset managers' commitment because every manager is held accountable for each voting decision,\" said Katsuya Kikuchi, associate director at Tokio Marine Asset Management.\n",
      "Increased domestic activism is likely to help firms burnish credentials on issues as varied as the environment, society and governance, raising their appeal for foreign investors looking to increase exposure to Japan, asset managers said.\n",
      "Domestic asset managers have voted \"against management in increasing amounts every year for the last five years,\" said Seth Fischer, founder of Hong Kong-based Oasis Management, which has invested in Japanese firms including Toshiba Corp (6502.T).\n",
      "Still, only a fraction of shareholder proposals gain support from domestic institutional investors. Last year, these investors supported just 6.8% of such proposals on average at shareholder meetings served by electric voting platform operator ICJ, versus 15% among foreign counterparts.\n",
      "Foreigners lead shareholder activism in Japan with domestic asset managers mainly playing a supportive role, though some investors have said they hope domestic managers will take more initiative and make their own proposals for company management.\n",
      "Some domestic asset managers supported Oasis which queried related-party transactions at Fujitec Co Ltd (6406.T) and opposed a management proposal to nominate its chief executive to the board of directors. The elevator maker withdrew the proposal an hour before its annual shareholder meeting last month.\n",
      "In another vote this year, Singapore-based 3D Investment Partners' campaign to bring its nominees onto the board of IT firm Fuji Soft Inc (9749.T) received unexpectedly high support of nearly 40%.\n",
      "Those voting in favour included Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc's (8306.T) Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking, Mizuho Financial Group Inc's (8411.T) Asset Management One and Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc's (8309.T) Nikko Asset Management.\n",
      "\"Before 2014, we'd hear investee firms moan about foreign investors' strict voting policies,\" said Hidenori Yoshikawa, corporate governance consultant at Daiwa Institute of Research. \"But as domestic institutional investors tightened their stance, we now hear investees say domestic investors are stricter.\"\n",
      "Domestic asset managers have been less supportive of company management than some global peers, showed a report by shareholder advisory SquareWell Partners which analysed voting for incumbent director elections at Japan's 100 biggest firms.\n",
      "Average support rates from 2019 to 2021 stood at 95.9% at Asset Management One, 94.2% at Nikko Asset Management and 88.9% at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management. That compared with 99.9% and 99.7% at U.S. peers Vanguard and BlackRock respectively.\n",
      "Still, it is rare for an activist shareholder motion to win approval in Japan where only four cases have been successful, partly as management is often insulated by passive ownership.\n",
      "But domestic asset managers are increasingly turning on management-protecting schemes, such as takeover defences and cross-shareholding arrangements.\n",
      "Daiwa Securities Group Inc's (8601.T) Daiwa Asset Management and other major asset managers this year tightened rules for director voting at firms engaged in cross-shareholding, which still account for about 30% of Japan's $6 trillion stock market.\n",
      "Also driving change is greater scrutiny from asset owners such as the Government Pension Investment Fund and Pension Fund Association for Local Government Officials, asset managers said.\n",
      "There is also room for improvement in board independence and diversity, said Takuya Iyoda, chief analyst at Nissay Asset Management. Rules could be tightened to the extent that boards must have a majority of independent directors, he said.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't be surprised if requirements for diversity eventually expand to include not just women but also non-Japanese.\"\n",

      "Fueled by extreme heat and tinder-dry forests and underbrush, the Oak Fire that began on Friday closed within half a mile (0.8 km) from the town of Mariposa Pines but was still more than 10 miles (16 km) from Yosemite, famed for its giant, ancient sequoia trees.\n",

      "Cal Fire officials said they had robust firefighting teams on scene early on, but the fire progressed atypically and overran their best efforts.\n",
      "The fire was moving east up into the sierra, toward the town of Mariposa Pines and in the direction of Yosemite, Justin Macomb, a Cal Fire operations section chief, told the public meeting.\n",
      "\"The fire quickly outflanked us. We couldn't even attack it with the resources that we had on hand,\" Macomb said. \"In my career, I haven't seen fire behavior like that.\"\n",
      "The cause of the fire remained under investigation.\n",
      "Yosemite, about an hour's drive from Mariposa County, is home to some of the largest and oldest sequoia trees in the world. The trees had been threatened by another wildfire earlier this month, but firefighters managed to save them.\n",

      "The Norwegian was beaten into second in the 1,500m by Briton Jake Wightman but avoided any risk of a similar last 200m burn-up by going clear after the early stages had been slow in very warm early evening conditions.\n",
